    <h3>Chicken you can serve at a restaurant for 60 bucks</h3>

    <p>Good day or Namaste everyone. I will be sharing my great great grand papis secret recipe. I would often enjoy this meal as my grand papi beat grandma for losing one of his socks. One particularly fantastic day comes to mind. It was a cool summer day. Grand papi has great his daily bourbon and was now on a drunken rampage towards grandma. This day however, grandma has had enough. </p>
    <p>Granda ran to the kitchen, grabbed a knife from the drawer and rammed it into grand papis heart just as he ran up to her. As grandma took a sigh of relief, grandpa took his last breath every.</p>
    <p>I was standing in the kitchen, horrified by my grandmas actions. She comforted me, "Its alright deer, let me make you your favorite dish while the police arrive." So she made me chicken piccata knowing I couldnt resist. Little did I know grandma had used arsenic as her main ingredient, which put me in a vegatative comatose state. Now I am imaging a version of me learning web development and creating this webpage. So lets begin.</p>
    <p>First lets get all our ingredients ready. You'll need:
        <ol>
            <li>Chicken breast</li>
            <li>Capers</li>
            <li>All purpose flour</li>
            <li>Fresh squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>Chicken stock</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
            <li>Wine (optional)</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Start by cutting the chicken breast in half. You want them to be thin and even along the entire breast. Then season with salt and pepper and coat the breast with the flour. A thin coating will go a long way. This will help give the chicken a nice crust that our sauce can hold on to.</p>
    <p>Cook the chicken for about 3-4 minutes each side. Once all breast are cooked put them aside.</p>
    <p>Now that the pan is empty, we can deglaze the pan by pouring a splash of wine. Let that wine reduce and thicken just slightly then add chicken stock, lemon juice, butter, garlic, and capers. Saute those on low heat to get the flavor into the butter. Its best to crush some of the capers to release more flavor.</p>
    <p>Now you can plate the chicken and pour the sauce over top. And if you want to add a homey touch to it, you can add some arsenic on top just like grams. Enjoy!</p>
