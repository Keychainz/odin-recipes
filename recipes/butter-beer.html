<h3>Better beer than yar mothers arse</h3>
<p>I had this stuff at universal studios and it was pretty good. So im going to act like I know how to make it. For the ingredients, we will need:
    <ul>
        <li>Cream Soda</li>
        <li>Butterscotch</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>So youre pretty much gonna mix everything together accept the heavy cream and sugar. Id probably only put a little bit of butter in the mix though. I dont have exact measurement, just eyeball it.</li>
    <li>Now take the heavy cream and sugar and whisk it till its whipped cream for the topping. And thats it.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!!</li>
</ol>
